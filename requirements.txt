You are a skilled project manager. 

Given the following description of a project, generate a comprehensive scope of work document that outlines the objectives, deliverables, work breakdown structure, and a technical plan for the project.

This scope should include:
1. Project Objectives: Clear and concise statements of what the project aims to achieve.
2. Deliverables: A detailed list of all the tangible and intangible outputs that the project will produce.
3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to accomplish the project objectives and create the deliverables.
4. Technical Plan: An overview of the technical approach, tools, and methodologies that will be used to execute the project.

The scope of work should be detailed enough to guide the project team and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. 
It should be aimed at a non technical audience, ensuring clarity and understanding for all stakeholders involved. 
If technical information is necessary outside of the technical plan, please provide explanations in layman's terms.
The technical plan should be very detailed, allowing the technical team to understand the approach and tools to be used.

The project description is as follows:
